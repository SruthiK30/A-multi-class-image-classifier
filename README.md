# A-multi-class-image-classifier
Trained a ResNet-18-based multi-class image classifier in two phases: first using labeled data, then applying semi-supervised learning with unlabeled data to improve performance. Generated test set predictions and documented the complete pipeline in a clean, modular Colab notebook.
